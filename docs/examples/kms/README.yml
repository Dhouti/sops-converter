Permissions required for AWS KMS on the controller side can be as simple as:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "YOUR_KSM_KEY_ARN"
        }
    ]
}
```

Anyone editing encrypted secrets will also need `kms:Encrypt` on for the relevant KMS keys.


There are multiple options for adding the necessary AWS permissions to the controller.
